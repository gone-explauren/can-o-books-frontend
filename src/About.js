        <h3>Hi, my name is Laurel</h3>
        <h4>...and I am the curator of this humble Library :)</h4>
        <p>I exclusively read poetry and medieval manuscripts, preferably ones about hunting witches written by 15th century German clergymen who have wet dreams about ancient Rome whilst overlooking all the heresy and the "synfull" homosexuality that was so commonplace back then.</p>
        <p>If you try to add a book to this Library that does not fit the above criteria, I will send my bookworms out to devour your soul.</p>
        <p>Like, you won't see them coming, and this website will do nothing to stop you in your devilish quest, but trust me. They will get you. And you will die.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Anyway! Go ahead and relax, enjoy some warm chamomile and rosehip tea, and indulge in the Library's simple pleasures~</p>
