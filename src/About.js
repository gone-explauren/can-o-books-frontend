        <h3>Hi, my name is Laurel and I made this :)</h3>
        <p>I exclusively read poetry and medieval manuscripts, preferablly ones about hunting witches written by 15th centurey Garman clergymen who have wet dreams about ancient Rome while overlooking all the heresy and homosexuality that took place back then.</p>
        <p>If you try to add a book to this library that does not fit the above criteria, I will send my bookworms out to devour your soul.</p>
        <p>Like, you won't see them coming, and this website will do nothing to stop you in your devilish quest, but trust me. They will get you. And you will die.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Anyway! Go ahead and relax, enjoy some tea,and indulge in the library's simple pleasures~</p>
